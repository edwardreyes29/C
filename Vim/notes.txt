1. Basics

	A. Start and quit Vim
		// Start Vim
		$ vim 
		// Quit Vim
		esc OR ctrl-C ----> :qa!

		: = Prefix for entering command-line mode 
		q = Shortcut for quit
		a = All buffers
			- You can have several files open in Vim
			- This lets you quit all of them
		! = Force

	B. Dual mode 
		Two modes: insert mode & normal mode
			1. Insert mode for writing text -> press I to enter insert mode | press esc to enter normal mode
			2. Normal mode for manipulating text
				In normal mode, each key has meaning related to text manipulation 
				Vim starts in normal mode
		


	C. Insert text
		vim textfile.txt
		press i to enter insert mode

	D. Save and quit
		vim textfile.txt
		press i to enter insert mode 
		after entering text, press esc or Ctrl-C 
		then type :w 


		To write to a file:
			:w textFile.txt // Creates or opens file

		To edit file:
			:e textFile.txt 

		To see file currently editing
			Ctrl-G

	Challenge: Create a file called knowledge.txt that contains the following content:
		"The only source of knowledge is experience."
