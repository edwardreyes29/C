Resident Evil 3 is another killer remaster from Capcom. Raccoon City has been recreated in stunning detail, peppered with realistically abandoned spaces, charming in-game advertising, and devastating environmental storytelling, while labyrinthine level design full of challenging nasties makes exploring a delight.

Like Resident Evil 2 before it, Resident Evil 3’s 2020 remake does an amazing job of recapturing the horror and tension of the late ‘90s original while completely modernizing its gameplay. It plays like a 2020 game because it is a 2020 game.
The classic world is brought to life in glorious detail, and smart level design makes exploring it a delight and replaying it almost compulsory. If only all remakes could be this good; bring on the next one.
