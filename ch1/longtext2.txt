When Tom Nook has upgraded Resident Services into a proper town hall, there will be a few noteworthy features added to the list of services the building provides. One essential service tied into Tom Nook's plan to increase your town's image is Island Evaluations - or Town Ratings.

Speaking to Isabelle, she'll tell you how your island ranks on a 5 star scale - with 1 star being the poorest. In order to achieve Tom Nook's goal of getting your island in the spotlight, you'll need to achieve a 3 Star Town Rating for your island, and we'll list all the ways you can raise your island's rating in the sections below. 
Not everyone wants to visit a deserted island - and so Isabelle will give you feedback indicating the population may need to be bigger in order to get a more favorable rating.

At the time the Campground is completed, your town should have at least 6 residents - but you'll want to get at least 7 or more to at least meet the qualifications to hit 3 Star Rank. After the first campground villager decides to move in, you'll be able to start selling plots of land for villagers to move into - letting you set the terms of their arrival. More villagers may arrive at the campground or on Mystery Islands, or they may just claim a plot of land if they like your island enough.

You can also force villagers to appear using Amiibo Cards, which Isabelle will unlock at the Resident Services. This will force the amiibo card villager to immediately appear at your campground, but to entice them to stay in your town, you may need to do tasks for them over a few days, and then have a plot of land for them to buy.
