   Create a file:
    touch filename.txt 

    edit file:
        cat > filename.txt 
            press Ctrl-D when finished 
    Display contents in file:
        cat filename.txt 


    // Read from a text file in C:
    ./cprogram < filename.txt
   
    %d - integers
    %f - float
    %o - octal
    %x - hexadecimal 
    %s - character string
    %% - % itself

V. Characer Input and Output

    text stream: sequence of characters divded into lines
    a d g g g h d \n
    k i d w i l d \n

    Repsonisibility of the library to make each input or output stream conform to this model.

    getchar // reads next input character from text stream and returns its value.
    - returns a distinctive value when there is no more solution. EOF - end of file 

        c = getchar() // c contains next character input

    putchar // prints a character each time it is called.

    putchar(c)  // prints contents of the integer variable c as a character

    A. File Copying
        read a character 
        while (characcter is not end-of-file indicator)
            output the character just read
            read a character
